# Breakout Game

Breakout is a classic arcade game in which the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bounces a ball against a wall of bricks at the top of the screen. The game's goal is to clear all the bricks by hitting them with the ball before the ball hits the bottom of the screen. The game is made with Python using the turtle library, which provides a set of functions for creating graphical games and animations. The player controls the paddle using the arrow keys and the game uses collision detection to determine when the ball hits a brick or the paddle. Overall, Breakout is a fun and challenging game that is sure to provide hours of entertainment.
